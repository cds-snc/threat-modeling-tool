    "description": "**Motivation for externalizing this threat model:** ```We've included an example of how you could use Threat composer to create a threat model, we have chosen the threat composer tool itself as an example to illustrate this. This threat model does not claim to be 100% complete for every possible interaction. It aims to give the reader an example of what a set of threats, assumptions and mitigations could look like. We've chosen to share this example as it provides a common reference point for people who are starting off with Threat composer. You may have different perspectives on the assumptions, threats and mitigations. This is ok, and could be used to start conversations in your organization within the context of your risk appetite. You may want to use this as he base threat model as a starting point to generate a contextualised threat model for your own specific needs and deployment of Threat composer. You are responsible for making your own independent assessment of this threat model and its applicability to your organization.```\n\n## Goal\n\nA simple threat modeling tool to help humans to reduce time-to-value when threat modeling\n\n## Summary\n\nThe process of [threat modeling](https://catalog.workshops.aws/threatmodel/en-US/introduction) helps you identify security issues and develop a strategy to address them in the *context* of your system.  A threat model directly supports your ability to define, agree upon, and communicate what is necessary in order to deliver a secure product or service. You can threat model very early in your design phase. These early insights put you in a better position to identify sensible design choices early in the cycle, and efficiently build and ship your workload securely. Identifying and fixing security issues at design time is exponentially easier to do than doing so once the workload has been built.\n\nThere are many ways to perform threat modeling. Much like programming languages, there are advantages and disadvantages to each. You should choose the approach that works for you, and communicate it within your organization. A good place to start is [Shostack’s 4 Question Frame for Threat Modeling](https://github.com/adamshostack/4QuestionFrame) which proposes four simple open ended questions.\n\nThe Threat composer tool has been built for the following reasons:\n\n1. **Coming up with useful threats can be hard.** Feedback from builders regarding the \"What can go wrong?\" question is that there are two key challenges in this step - firstly, no generally agreed standard on what 'good' looks like. This is contextual based on the system being assessed and the ownership model of the teams involved; and, secondly, there is no canonical list of possible things that could go wrong. Hence, threat identification necessitates brainstorming and collaboration between the individuals involved in the threat modeling process, and often involves starting from a \"blank page\". Threat composer uses [\"Threat Grammar\"](https://catalog.workshops.aws/threatmodel/en-US/what-can-go-wrong/threat-grammar), a prescriptive way to write threats, with the aim of making it easier to iteratively write useful threats. Threat Composer includes full examples to help the customer understand what good might look like. Customers can use these as inspiration or as a starting point for their own threats.\n2. **Provide insights on how to improve quality and coverage.** One of the toughest questions to answer is “did we do a good enough job?” because it can be highly subjective. Threat composer includes an ‘insights dashboard’ to help you quickly identify areas for improvement, including (a) threats without linked mitigations, (b) unprioritized threats, (c) threat category distribution, and (d) based on threat grammar usage, potential improvement to inputs for mitigation or prioritisation.\n3. **Threat modeling is non-linear.** Threat modeling is often taught as a linear process, where a person or team works on each of the threat modeling questions separately. In practice, threat modeling can be very non-linear. For example, you may think of a mitigation (“what are we going to do about?”) immediately after you’ve thought of a threat (“what can go wrong?), this may lead you to re-evaluate specific aspects of your design (”what are we building?“). Threat composer aims to support this kind of non-linear and natural workflow. \n4. **Threat modeling is iterative.** both at a micro and a macro level. For example, at a micro level, you may iterate on a given threat to the point you find you could [decompose](https://catalog.workshops.aws/threatmodel/en-US/what-can-go-wrong/threat-grammar/decomposition) it into two discrete threats. At a macro level, a threat model can (and should) evolve and mature as the system you are threat modeling evolves through the software/hardware development lifecycle. In the early stages of design you may need to make a lot of [assumptions](https://catalog.workshops.aws/threatmodel/en-US/what-are-we-working-on/exercise/state-your-assumptions), and as time passes previous assumptions may become invalidated which is a [trigger to review the threat model](https://catalog.workshops.aws/threatmodel/en-US/introduction/when-to-threat-model). Additionally, as you progress it’s likely that new design decisions are made, new threats are thought of and mitigations go from being “planned”, to being “implemented”. Threat composer has been designed to support this iterative design and development lifecycle, and to support the ability of having a “living” threat model-as-code as your feature or service evolves and matures.\n\n## Features\n\n* Capture and store systems description, architecture diagram, and dataflow diagram.\n* Capture and store assumptions related to the systems design, threats and/or mitigations, along with mapping of assumptions to threats to mitigations.\n* Help iteratively compose useful threats, and encourage brainstorming. This feature is also available via a dedicated [‘Threats Only’](https://awslabs.github.io/threat-composer?mode=ThreatsOnly) mode. \n    * Rendering structured threat statements (aligned to a prescriptive threat grammar) based on user input.\n    * Supporting an adaptive threat statement structure, this helps create progressively more complete threats.\n    * Provide dynamic suggestions based on supplied and missing user input.\n    * Provide complete threat statement examples to aid contextual brainstorming.\n* Capture and store mitigation candidates and mapping to threats.\n* Create a threat model document based on user-supplied input.\n* Help users answer \"Did we do a good enough job\" by providing insights and suggestions for bar-raising actions via an 'Insights dashboard'\n* Data persisted only client-side within the browser (100% local storage).\n* JSON import/export capabilities to enable persistent storage, sharing, and version control outside of the web browser (e.g. by using git).\n* Markdown and PDF static downloads of the threat model document.\n* Workspace separation to allow working on multiple threat models."
